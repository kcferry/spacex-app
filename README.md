# Getting Started with Create React App

Space Clover is a React.js based site designed to view the next SpaceX launch, SpaceX rockets, and the test journey of Starship. The site was built as a project for my portfolio but I will be adding more features in the future as it is something I have a keen interest in. The site is utilizing the SpaceX API by [r-spacex](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) along with the openweather, openstreetmap and mapBox apis. This site does not have any relations with Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX).
